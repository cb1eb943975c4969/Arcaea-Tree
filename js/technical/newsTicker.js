They pass on, unspoken.      They pass into memory.           Memory...      For better or worse, memory will not discriminate. A moment in the mind of one, or a moment shared by many, will take shape unspoiled. However innocuous, however tragic, however wonderful, a memory will capture it, though it may never be put to record.      And when unrecorded, what has passed into memory will inevitably fade into ether.      You might think that something forgotten can't have any importance. Perhaps that's true. Why remember a fall? Why remember sorrow? Why remember some sweet taste?      And certainly, the answers to those questions do matter...      ...but time does not slow while they're being asked.      As they're asked, as they are considered, an archive ceaselessly grows...         Some where and when...

A lone man draws his sword. Before him, a town burns. Behind, the marauders that have razed it look on the man, laughing. Knowing he will die, the man turns, and raises the blade--      Sewn in.

These flows of old thought and moments move in accordance with unknown laws. Or, perhaps, it is merely all a senseless dance. Some, granted, do not flow at all--they stay in place or float along, separate or within crowds of others. Whether they flow or remain still, \"glass\" defines this place.      Clouds alone have the sky. The light above them fills every soft fold, leaving hardly a shadow below. It is sometimes blinding, like an overbearing smile...      Below, the lands are often clear, empty. Just as often, the lands are filled with endless rows of structures and scattered monuments.      Colorless monuments, like the colorless lands. Wherefore do they stand?         Because \"place\" is inseparable from memory. That's it, no?      Where your tears have fallen, where you've held another's hand...      Surely you can remember.
